# covid-slot-booker
A python script that notifies users through email of free covid vaccine slots in their area

Forgive the bad code quality, one of my first projects.
Uses the Aarogya Setu API to get details of the vaccination slots and then uses SMTP to mail them to the emails listed in the mails dictionary.
Set main_mail to the sender email ID, password to the sender email ID's password and you should be good to go.
